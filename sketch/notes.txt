Get libffi: Install Gimp or Emacs and steal its libffi-6.dll

Get GCC, etc. (for configuring libffi stuff):
    Install MSYS2: https://msys2.github.io/
    In MSYS2 Install: pacman -S gcc libffi libffi-devel pkg-config
    Add msys64/usr/bin to your path. (so you can access gcc, etc.)

Finally: (ql:quickload :sketch)

I've kept a copy of the dlls you need on windows in this repo as libs.zip
so you don't have to download everything if you're working on 64bit Win10.
